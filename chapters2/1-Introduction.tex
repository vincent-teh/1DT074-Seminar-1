Topic C introduces the challenges and optimizations in containerized environments, focusing on Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins and Container Orchestration Distributions (CODs).
With the increasing use of containerized applications, selecting the right CNI or COD is crucial for achieving optimal performance and scalability.

The first paper \cite{C1} analyzes the performance of CNI plugins, comparing Flannel, Cilium, Calico, and Kube-router through both qualitative and quantitative analyses. 
It evaluates factors such as networking architecture, overhead, and latency to determine their suitability for different use cases.
The second paper \cite{C2} highlights Kubernetes' reliance on \textit{etcd} for cluster state management, identifying scalability issues in large clusters and proposing a method using Lazy syncing and Conflict-Free Replicated Datatypes (CRDTs) to enhance performance, particularly in edge environments.
The third paper \cite{C3} provides a comparative analysis of four CODs—k0s, k3s, Microk8s, and Microshift—assessing their resource usage, control-plane performance, and data-plane efficiency to guide selection based on deployment needs.
