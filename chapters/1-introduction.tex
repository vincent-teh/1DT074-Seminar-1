Topic B introduces QUIC, a novel transport layer protocol developed by Google in 2012. The development of QUIC was motivated by the need to address the ossification challenges associated with TCP in modern networking environments. Instead of building directly on top of the IP layer, QUIC leverages UDP as its substrate protocol, enabling greater feasibility and adoption in real-world applications.

The first paper explores the architecture of QUIC and highlights its significant impact, including its ability to handle 7\% of global internet traffic. The second paper emphasizes the protocol's flexibility and the strategies employed to mitigate ossification. Finally, the third paper reviews the efforts led by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to advance the protocol beyond the initial QUIC v1 specification.
