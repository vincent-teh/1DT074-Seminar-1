In conclusion, the three papers provide valuable insights into the challenges and innovations surrounding modern transport layer protocols, particularly with regard to latency reduction and combating Internet ossification. 
The first paper highlights QUIC's success in addressing latency and TCP's shortcomings, offering significant real-world performance improvements. The second paper proposes the NEAT architecture as a more flexible, future-proof approach to overcoming Internet architecture ossification, by allowing applications to dynamically select the most suitable transport protocol.
The third paper showcases the advancements made by the IETF in expanding and optimizing QUIC, ensuring its continued relevance in various networking contexts.
